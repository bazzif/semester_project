# Thesis Template
This is a latex template for your thesis. We recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write your thesis but there are many other options.

If you use Overleaf, you may link your reference management tool (Zotero or Mendeley) which eases the workflow of citing papers.
